* intro
** p265 middle localizing constitution of sexuality in practices of power-knowledge
** p265 shift focus to genealogy of modern subject within modern state
** p265 bottom sex is a point of departure for examining principles of subjectivity
** p266 top considerable revision of the original plan--focus on new historical epoch, antiquity
** p266 middle HoS books focus on processes of subjectivation and ethics
** p267 middle 2 last volumes HoS add nuance and relativize the project
** 267 fn Schmid "aesthetics of existence" counter to laws of normalization society
** 267 fn bottom: voices a political will "not to be governed" rather than "art of living"
** 268 top additional dimension of genealogical analysis
** 268 middle historical form of power that operates via subjects and their freedom
** 268 middle governing the self and forms of governing others
** 269 top sexuality is not an ontological constant
** 269 middle sexuality not an historical singularity
** 269 bottom investigate the forms in which people should recognize themselves as subjects of this particular sexuality
** 269 bottom 2 key concepts
*** technologies of the self
*** experience
* self
** 3 technologies used as analytical grids for all societies (p270 top and middle)
*** techniques allowing production, transformation, and manipulation of things
*** techniques for using sign systems
*** techniques that permit one to determine conduct of individuals, to impose ends or objectives
** also called "technologies of the self" p270 middle 
** p271 top these technologies allow ppl to  
*** transform themselves
*** modify themselves
*** reach attainable states
**** perfection
**** happiness
**** purity
**** supernatural power
** p271 middle: theoretical reflection bears on self-constitution of subjectivity
** pg271 bottom various technologies influence and condition each other
** pg271 bottom F is interested in relationship between technologies of domination and those of the self
** p272 middle technologies of domination do not simply determine technologies of the self
** p272 bottom not arbitrary, however, the relative autonomy of technologies of self constitutes them as indipendent object of investigation with a specific historicity
** p273 middle domination has recourse to processes by which the individual acts upon himself
** p273 middle integrated into structures of coercion or domination
** p273 bottom F focuses on the government of the self as it relates to other forms of government
** p274 top relationship to oneself and relationship to others are linked together
* subjectivityExperience
** p274 middle practices of the self
** p274 bottom "correlation between fields of knowledge, types of normanitivy and forms of subjectivity"
** p275 top seemingly personal and subjective matters in relation to forms of knowledge and processes of power
** p275 bottom processes of subjectivity
** p275 bottom positing an essential subject; subjectivity in terms of process of becoming
** p275 bottom experience in general represents one possible experience among others
** p275 no universal form of subject to be found everywhere
** p276 top first of all, view subjectivity as concrete historical construction, not as natural constant
** p276 top defining a subject is the product of specific ways of organizing subjectivity
** p276 middle 2nd--the experiences occur individually, but are connected within a social space defined by 
*** forms of knowledge
*** power practices
*** technologies of self
** p277 top 3rd experience involves basic devaluation
** p277 middle truth occupies a field of immanence
** p277 bottom body of sex rules separates the permitted from the forbidden
** p277 bottom individual can recognize oneself as a sexual subject among others
** p278 top instrinsic connection between the history of sex and governmentality
** p278 middle "why had we made sexuality into a moral experience?"
* moralityEthics
** p278 middle HoS examines changes in technologies of self on basis of moral reflection on sex
** p278 middle D&P takes on prison's normality
** p278 bottom vol2&3 involve breaking with what counts as self-evident--posing a question, problem
** p279 top why are other aspects of social life less morally charged than sex?
** p279 top why are childhood education and diet less morally charged than sex?
** p279 middle sex activities subject to codified prescriptions permitting and forbidding certain modes of conduct
** p279 middle F has problems with juridical approach of morality, this explanation is circular
** p279 bottom moral worry may be especially pronounced when there are no explicit imperatives for action or codified schemes
** p279 bottom aspects of moral sphere
*** real behaviour
*** rules and values which define + or - content
*** ways of conducting/moral subjectivity
** p280 top
"any fixed moral prescription admits different modes of self-relation.
The latter constitute what F calls ethics:
'the elaboration of a form of relation to self that enables an individual
to fashion himself into a subject of ethical conduct.""

** p280 middle
*** two axes of moral experience
**** codes
**** ethics
** p281 top
"Moral laws do not simply confront the moral subject from without; they cannot simply be imposed...
they must be willed and accepted, known and lived."
"F is interested in showing how morality takes on prohibitions and systems of obligation."
** p281 bottom
"only when morality and ethics do not constitute an analytical unit can one examine the
various forms their relationsh have assumed: drawing a distinction between them as separate categories
enables one to reconstruct why, historically, they have counted as one and the same" 
** p282 top
"For F, no essential subjectivity exists..."
"there is no subject per se different from the historical circumstances of its realization."
** p282 middle
"historicization (provides) the key to a reality that is no longer
defined as the particular instantiation of something more general..."
** p283 top
also "encompassing a universality inasmuch as it reveals it to be a singular form."
therefore genealogy of ethics is simultaneously the genealogy of the subject."
